# Real-Time Slack Pager on ESP8266 and SSD1306 OLED display

This sketch turns your ESP chip into real time Slack pager, dedicated display for Slack channels.

Before running this Sketch, make sure the set the following constants in the program:

* `SLACK_TOKEN` - The API token of your slack bot (get it at https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot)
* `WIFI_SSID` - Your WiFi network name (SSID)
* `WIFI_PASSWORD` - Your WiFi password

In addition, you will need to install the following Arduino libraries:
- [WebSockets](https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets), 
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson),
- [ESP8266-oled-ssd1306](https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-oled-ssd1306)

I used NodeMCU ESP board for this code (available for less than $10 at http://amzn.to/29v9AaZ) and SSD1306 (available for $10 at http://amzn.to/2kKtu7w). You can also buy these for a lot cheaper if you can wait a couple weeks: NodeMCU for $5.26 at http://www.banggood.com/NodeMcu-Lua-WIFI-Internet-Things-Development-Board-Based-ESP8266-CP2102-Wireless-Module-p-1097112.html?p=NR1115712752201408A0 and OLED screen for $5.49 at http://www.banggood.com/0_96-Inch-4Pin-White-IIC-I2C-OLED-Display-Module-12864-LED-For-Arduino-p-958196.html?p=NR1115712752201408A0

TODO : 

- [ ] When initial JSON is received from Slack, create a hash table of channel IDs/their names and also user IDs/usernames so that you could see what channel the message is coming from
- [ ] Connect Neopixels and specify certain triggers for various colors
- [ ] Enable a way to specify what channel you want to listen in, instead of all channels where the bot is present

New fingerprint most likely needs to be set in code, will do this on a lazy sunday ;)
echo | openssl s_client -connect slack.com:443 | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout
SHA1 Fingerprint=C1:0D:53:49:D2:3E:E5:2B:A2:61:D5:9E:6F:99:0D:3D:FD:8B:B2:B3
